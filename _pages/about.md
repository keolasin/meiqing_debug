I am a PhD student in City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a transportation planner in the San Francisco Bay Area. I received a Master of City Planning with Certificate in GIS and Spatial Analysis from Stuart Weitzman School of Design, University of Pennsylvania, and B.A. in Urban Studies and Economics from the University of Hong Kong. 

My research explores the intersection of sustainable transportation, travel behavior, and built environment in the US and Asia.
