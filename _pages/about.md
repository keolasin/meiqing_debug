I am a PhD candidate in City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a transportation planner in the San Francisco Bay Area. I received my Master of City Planning with a Certificate in GIS and Spatial Analysis from Stuart Weitzman School of Design, University of Pennsylvania, and a B.A. in Urban Studies and Economics from the University of Hong Kong. 

My research explores the intersection of sustainable transportation, travel behavior, and built environment in the US and Asia.
